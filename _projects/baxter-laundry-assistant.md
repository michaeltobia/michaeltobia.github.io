# Baxter - Laundry Assistant

This project was completed by me and a group of four other classmates for our
Embedded Systems in Robotics course at Northwestern. This class strongly focused
on the use of ROS in robotic applications.

In this project, Baxter was programmed to locate a large detergent bottle,
grasp the bottle's lid, unscrew the lid, and finally remove the bottle lid. As
a stretch goal, we also programmed Baxter to replace the lid on the bottle. The
following gifs show this package in action:
