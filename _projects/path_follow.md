This project was completed for my Advanced Mechatronic course at Northwestern.
In a way, the entire course centered around designing this path following vehicle,
but the ultimate goal was for the vehicle to follow a rainbow colored path well
enough to complete an entire circuit.

This course was incredibly engaging. The focus on mechatronics meant the path
following vehicle was designed from scratch right down to the circuit board,
