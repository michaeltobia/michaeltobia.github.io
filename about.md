## About Me

Hello!

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Michael Tobia and I am a recent graduate from
Northwestern University where I earned my Masters in Robotics. Here you will
find a collection of my projects and my professional information. My projects and
studies cover a wide range of subjects, but typically focus on computer vision,
robotic manipulation, controls, mechatronics, and mechanical design.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Houston with a Bachelors in
Mechanical Engineering. Many of my personal and academic projects
involve some mixture of mechanical, software, and electronic design. I enjoy
approaching most things with a mixed-subject focus like this. My hobbies,
which include car modification, music production, prototyping, and adventure
sports, also allow me to apply my engineering experience in other areas of my life.



Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio. If you would like to get a hold of
me, please find my contact information on this site, or feel free to email me
at michaeledwardtobia@gmail.com
