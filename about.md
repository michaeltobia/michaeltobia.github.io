## About Me

I'm a Master's student at Northwestern University studying robotics with a focus
on robotic manipulation, mechanics, and control.

With passion and determination I seek to create novel and useful problem solutions
in all of my projects. My background includes a Bachelor's of Science in engineering
from the University of Houston along with a wide range of project and job experience.
Currently I am working on a generalized force control package with Rethink Robotics' Sawyer
and an end-effector-attached Force/Torque sensor.

If you would like to get a hold of me, please find my contact information on this
site, or feel free to email me at michaeledwardtobia@gmail.com
